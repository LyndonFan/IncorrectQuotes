# What's an Incorrect Quote?

> Aristotle: Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe.

The above is an incorrect quote: a real quote said by a person but misattributed to another. Here, we don't even know who actually said it -- some say Einstein, others say Newton. The point is that it looks like something the new person could have said.

On tubmlr, the quotes are usualy scenarios / dialogues from characters in media (books / TV shows / movies) but with other characters subsituted in.
